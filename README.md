# 👋 Hi, I’m @Koowah 
- also known as NasLrgb

👀 I’m interested in Machine Learning, Data Science, Data Engineering & Blockchain

🌱 I’m currently learning to open the gatez and allow for the merger to happen

💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ... on ... wait, i'll think about it.





📫 I'm just getting started on my ML/Data journey, but here's my kaggle profile https://www.kaggle.com/anaslargab

Quite a few data/statistics oriented projects will be published in the next couple months.
I'll be working on writing proper readme's and documenting all my work soon.

Cheers 😄
